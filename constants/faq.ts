    question: "What is this tool and what does it do?",
    answer:
      "Our platform is a visual database schema design tool that lets you create, document, and export database schemas. Design schemas visually with drag-and-drop or write them in SQL/DBML code. Generate documentation instantly and export to multiple formats including SQL, DBML, and visual diagrams.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I create my first database schema?",
    answer:
      "Start by adding tables to the canvas using the 'Add Table' button. Click on a table to add columns, set data types, and define constraints. Connect tables by creating relationships between them. You can also switch to code mode to write your schema in SQL or DBML format.",
  },
  {
    question: "What export formats are supported?",
    answer:
      "We support multiple export formats including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle SQL. You can also export to DBML format or generate visual documentation. Each export preserves your schema structure, relationships, and constraints.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I collaborate with my team on schemas?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Share your workspace with team members and collaborate in real-time. Each member can have different roles (owner, admin, editor, viewer) to control access levels. Multiple people can work on the same schema simultaneously with instant sync.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import existing database schemas?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Paste your existing SQL or DBML code into the code editor, and we'll automatically parse and visualize your schema. We support imports from PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other major database dialects, converting them into visual diagrams you can edit.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between visual and code modes?",
    answer:
      "Visual mode lets you design schemas using drag-and-drop interface with tables, relationships, and areas. Code mode provides a text editor where you can write SQL or DBML directly. Both modes stay in sync - changes in one automatically update the other, giving you flexibility to work however you prefer.",
  },
